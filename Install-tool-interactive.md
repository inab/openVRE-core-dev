## VRE Tool dockerization & adaptation guide


Since the Virtual Research environment is a dockerized system, also for tools integration a similar dockerization method is followed, so to encapsulate the tools and their dependencies in a container, allowing for easy sharing, version control, and deployment.

This guide walks through the process of Dockerizing a sequence extraction tool and integrating it into a Virtual Research Environment (VRE) framework.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following are installed:

- **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)**: Follow this link to install Docker.
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)**: Follow this link to install Git.


# Step 1: Creating a Dockerfile for your tool

In this example we are going to use a VTK Viewer tool, an interactive VTK based viewer for 3-dimensional objects.

The Dockerfile sets up the environment by installing dependencies like Biopython and placing the necessary Python script into the container.

**Create the Dockerfile** in your project directory *openVRE/vre_mock_tool/*, that defines the environment and the tool configuration. Using as an example the extraction tool mentioned as before: 

```
FROM ubuntu:20.04

# Set non-interactive mode for apt-get
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y wget cmake g++ make libxt6 libglu1-mesa libxrender1 \
                       python3 python3-pip libegl1 libegl1-mesa libgl1-mesa-glx \
                       software-properties-common curl libopengl0 libgl1-mesa-dri libglx0 libgl1-mesa-dev

# Add deadsnakes PPA and install Python 3.10
RUN add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa && \
    apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y python3.10 python3.10-venv python3.10-dev && \
    update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.8 1 && \
    update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.10 2 && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Node Version Manager (NVM) and Node.js
RUN curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash && \
    export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" && \
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" && \
    nvm install 6 && \
    npm install -g pvw-visualizer

# Download and extract ParaView
RUN wget https://www.paraview.org/files/v5.12/ParaView-5.12.1-egl-MPI-Linux-Python3.10-x86_64.tar.gz && \
    tar -xvf ParaView-5.12.1-egl-MPI-Linux-Python3.10-x86_64.tar.gz && \
    rm ParaView-5.12.1-egl-MPI-Linux-Python3.10-x86_64.tar.gz

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /ParaView-5.12.1-egl-MPI-Linux-Python3.10-x86_64

# Expose the port
EXPOSE 8090

# Command to start the ParaView visualizer
CMD ["./bin/pvpython", "-m", "paraview.apps.visualizer", "--data", "/data", "--port", "8090", "--host", "0.0.0.0"]

```

**Make sure for the ENTRYPOINT to refer directly to the script/software that you would want to launch on the platform.** The VRE framework will use this as the direct command for the wrapper. 
---

**Build the Docker image** once the Dockerfile is set up, with the command:

Remember to change the name of the Dockerfile from *Dockerfile_template* to **Dockerfile** to be able to build the image. 

```bash
docker build -t my_tool_image .
```

In this tool case, the image would be available on **[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mapoferri/vtk_viewer/general)**
---



## VRE integration:


1.  Adding the Tool in the MongoDB collection;

2. In /volumes/openVRE/tools, make a new directory copying the tool_skeleton one with the name of the tool (same ID that was used in Mongo);

3. Modify the input.php file (*especially the $tool_id*) based on the requirments of the tools (more inputs, more arguments);

4. Modify the /volumes/openVRE/tools/$your_tool/assets/home/ the index.html file, for ur tool to be consinstent with the mongoDB. 


Follow the instructions in detail [here](https://github.com/inab/openVRE/wiki/Register-new-interactive-tool).



## Conclusion

By following these steps, youâ€™ve successfully Dockerized your tool, integrated it with the OpenVRE environment, and configured the necessary Dockerfiles to run the tool in both local and OpenVRE environments.
