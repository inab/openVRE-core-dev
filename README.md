# Open Virtual Research Environment core development (openVRE-core-dev)

OpenVRE (Open Virtual Research Environment) is an open-source, cloud-based platform designed to facilitate the creation, 
management and customization of Virtual Research Environments (VREs). OpenVRE bridges the gap between HPC resources, 
sensitive data infrastructures and analytical tools and workflows, providing a flexible environment that enables secure 
data access, scalable computation and collaboration.

This repository contains the source code for the openVRE core development version, which includes the core components of
the platform. Other software pieces as the tools, visualizers and data are specific to the each openVRE deployment.

A production-ready version of openVRE can be found in the [openVRE](https://github.com/inab/openVRE) repository. It also
includes a complete documentation of the platform at the respository [wiki](https://github.com/inab/openVRE/wiki).

⚠️ This documentation is a work in progress and may not correspond with the production version repository documentation.

For installation, check the [Install](https://github.com/inab/openVRE-core-dev/tree/master/Install.md) documentation. 

After the installation is complete, you can access the platform at the following URL: [http://localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088).
